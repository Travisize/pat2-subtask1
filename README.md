The historical context of why Morse Code was created.
Morse Code emerged from the need for a practical system to interpret and transmit messages using electrical telegraphy, a groundbreaking invention in the mid-19th century. The telegraph could send electrical pulses, but a coding system was needed to translate those pulses into readable text, leading to the creation of Morse Code. Morse Code's evolution involved refinements and the adoption of different versions, particularly the International Morse Code, which became the global standard.
