## Brief Overview of Morse Code
Morse code is a method used to encode text characters as sequences of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). It was originally developed for long-distance communication using telegraph systems. Each letter of the alphabet, as well as numbers and some punctuation, has a unique combination of dots and dashes. For example, the letter “A” is represented as “.-” and the letter “B” as “-...”.

Morse code allows messages to be transmitted using sound, light, or visual signals, making it useful in both modern and historical contexts—especially in situations where voice communication is not possible.

## Historical Context of Morse Code
Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail as part of the invention of the telegraph. The first message sent using Morse code was “What hath God wrought?” in 1844 between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.

Initially designed for telegraph wires, Morse code quickly became the international standard for maritime communication and emergency signaling. Its simplicity and effectiveness kept it in use for over a century, particularly in military and aviation fields, until it was eventually replaced by more modern digital communication systems.

## How Morse Code Works
Morse code encodes each letter, number, or symbol into a series of **dots (·)** and **dashes (−)**:
- A **dot** is a short signal.
- A **dash** is a longer signal.

Each character has a unique pattern. For example:
- **C** = `-.-.`
- **H** = `....`
- **3** = `...--`

Letters are separated by a space, and words are separated by a longer pause or double space.

The code can be transmitted via:
- Sound (beeps or clicks)
- Light (e.g., flashing a flashlight)
- Visual marks (e.g., printed dots and dashes)

This makes Morse code highly adaptable across different technologies and environments.
